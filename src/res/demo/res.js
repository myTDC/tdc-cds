Our today’s article is devoted right to this aspect of user experience design: let’s check what readability and legibility are, why it’s important to care about them, what factors influence them in user interfaces, and how to improve them for usability and desirability of web or mobile user interface.", 
                            "Why would you want to read about all that stuff? The reason is simple but big: app users or website visitors won’t read the content if it doesn’t look clear and digestible to them."],                         
                        2: ["Legibility of content is focused on how people see it and distinguish elements one from another. So, at this perspective, you deal with how people see the content on the page or screen, distinguish its elements and recognize them (for example, characters, words, sentences, numbers, etc). Based on that, we can say that legibility is more about the visual presentation of content that makes it edible and lets users quickly understand what is what on the page or screen.", 
                            "As for readability definition, it’s easily found right in the name of the phenomenon: readability is the ease of written content perception. In its classic understanding, readability is the next level going deeper into the comprehension of the text content. It deals with the simplicity of words and sentences, clarity of thoughts, ease of consuming information and understandable structure of the text blocks."],

                            "For example, similarly to physical objects perceived on different backgrounds, black copy shown on white or light background seems to be larger than the white copy on a dark background. The wrong color scheme may result in poor readability which in its turn leads to poor user experience: users aren’t able to scan the data, even more – even if the data is relevant but not readable, users feel the inexplicable tense struggling with the text or even miss some critical information."]
